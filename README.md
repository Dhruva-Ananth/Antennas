# Satellite Antenna requirements
All about Antennas and some HFSS simulations on how they work and look like

The following questions shall be addressed for each of the desired antenna systems
• What is the operating frequency range of the system ?
• How much gain is required ?
• What kind of radiation pattern is desired?
• What is the maximum allowable VSWR?
• What polarization is required?
• What type of connector interface is required?
• How much power will the antenna have to handle?
• Where will the antenna be mounted?
• Is a radome required?
• What is the lifetime of the antenna?

Following Designs are certain requirements in the field of Satellite antenna systems.
